## Ingredients 
- Noodles 🍜
- Marinera sauce 🍅
- Peas 🫛
 ## Instructions
- Boil noodles.
- strain noodles and add marinara sauce.
- Add peas
- Serve in bowl, put puma's entries on top.

## additional considerations
  - lately I really liked the three cheese marinara sauce. But any sauce will do.

  - I think I want to try the old noodles that I had before. I'll take a picture the next time I buy them.
