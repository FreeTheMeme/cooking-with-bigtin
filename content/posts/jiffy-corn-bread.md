For the past few years, I have loved making Jiffy products. They're super simple to make. I have recently got a muffin tin
## IngredientsÂ 
- Jiffy Cornbread
- 1 egg
- 1/3 cup of milk
- One tablespoon (tbsp) of butter.

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
2. Mix the Jiffy Cornbread one egg, third cup of milk and butter. 
3. Cook time depends on what medium you're pouring it into.
	- If you are using a muffin tin, go with the recommended time in the box, 12 to 15 minutes. It's usually done in like, I would say 13, 14, but your mileage may vary.
	- But if you're doing it in a pan, how I usually do it, it's usually 20 to 25 minutes.
4. Give it time to cool. And you're done! 

## additional considerations 
- If you want to make more, just multiply the ingredients by the amount of boxes You want to make.
- Also if you want something with a little bit more moisture I recommend going with the honey version of the cornbread. 
- But if you only want a little bit more moisture, just add more butter.
