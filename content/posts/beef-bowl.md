- 3 [garlic cloves](https://www.target.com/p/spice-world-fresh-whole-garlic-3ct-bag/-/A-14917318?aflt=plt) minced
- 1/4 cup [packed brown sugar](https://www.target.com/p/light-brown-sugar-2lbs-good-38-gather-8482/-/A-78494376?aflt=plt)
- 1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons [sesame oil](https://amzn.to/2K07UH4)
- 1/4 teaspoon [ground ginger](https://www.target.com/p/organic-ground-ginger-1-6oz-good-38-gather-8482/-/A-77616562?aflt=plt)
- 1/4 teaspoon [crushed red pepper flakes](https://www.target.com/p/crushed-red-pepper-1-5oz-good-38-gather-8482/-/A-77584991?aflt=plt)
- 1/4 teaspoon [pepper](https://www.target.com/p/ground-black-pepper-3oz-good-38-gather-8482/-/A-77585121?aflt=plt)
- 2 cups hot cooked white or brown rice
- sliced green onions and sesame seeds for garnish

## Instructions¬†

- In a large skillet cook the ground beef and garlic breaking it into crumbles over medium heat until no longer pink. Drain the grease. *I use some paper towel to soak up the grease*
    
- In a small bowl whisk brown sugar, soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger, red pepper flakes and pepper. Pour over the ground beef and let simmer for another minute or two.
    
    
- Serve over hot rice and garnish with green onions and sesame seeds.


## additional considerations

### Can you make this with chicken?

Yes! This is a great chicken flavor as well. Saut√© your chicken with all the ingredients. Cook until it is no longer pink.
