Today, I bought a cookbook from the store downtown. I looked at cookbooks there before so many times and never bought a single book, but today I bought it because that I had cornbread recipes, which I've always really liked cornbread. It's kind of a meme at this point. I'll probably post my own cornbread recipe here at one point. I have it in my obsidian vault, so I just gotta go find it and put it into the website.
